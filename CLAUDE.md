# Bill's Books — Claude Code Session Guide

## What This App Does

Static GitHub Pages app that recommends books from Bill's personal to-read list and a curated external candidate pool. The recommendation engine scores candidates by cross-referencing his Goodreads history (ratings, themes, similar titles).

**Live site:** https://boilerbill83.github.io/my-books/

## Session Start Checklist

1. **Set the remote** (PAT is stored locally outside any git repo — never commit it or reference its path in committed files):
   ```bash
   PAT=$(cat ~/.github_pat)   # adjust to wherever your PAT lives locally
   git remote set-url origin https://${PAT}@github.com/boilerbill83/my-books.git
   ```
2. **Push to main** (deploy triggers on main only):
   ```bash
   git push origin HEAD:main
   ```

## Perfect Book Entry — Quality Standard

A **perfect** book entry in `goodreadsData.json` has all of the following:

### Required fields (every book)
```json
{
  "title": "Exact title as shown on Goodreads",
  "author": "Author Name",
  "shelf": "read | to-read | currently-reading",
  "myRating": 0,
  "pages": 320,
  "avgRating": 4.12,
  "ratingsCount": 85000,
  "year": 2021
}
```

### Quality fields (must be present and correct)
```json
{
  "themes": ["thriller", "psychological", "domestic suspense"],
  "similarToTitles": ["The Silent Patient", "Behind Closed Doors", "Verity"]
}
```

### Quality rules

| Field | Rule |
|-------|------|
| `themes` | 2–5 tags; must use **canonical vocabulary only** (see below); must match the book's actual genre |
| `similarToTitles` | 3–5 entries; every title must be an **exact character-for-character match** to another book's `title` field in the dataset — the engine uses `Set.has()` for matching, so "The Firm" ≠ "The Firm (The Firm, #1)" |
| `pages` | Non-zero integer; 0 or missing means the pages-fit bonus never fires |
| `ratingsCount` | Positive integer; missing means the popularity bonus never fires |
| `myRating` | 0 (unrated) to 5; 0-star read books don't contribute to `authorRatingWeight` |
| `avgRating` | Goodreads community average; affects `(avg - 3.5) * 10` score term |

### Canonical theme vocabulary

Use **only** these values. Do not invent new tags without updating the engine's fallback constants.

**Fiction / Genre:**
`thriller`, `psychological`, `suspense`, `domestic suspense`, `mystery`, `crime`, `noir`, `horror`, `high-concept`, `spy`, `adventure`, `historical`, `YA`, `romance`, `literary`, `contemporary`, `speculative`, `sci-fi`, `social commentary`

**Nonfiction:**
`narrative nonfiction`, `memoir`, `biography`, `true crime`, `history`, `tech history`, `finance`, `business`, `sports`, `food`, `music history`, `political`, `military`, `psychology`

**Unassigned (use sparingly):**
`humor`, `comedy`

### How themes drive scoring

The engine builds a `fiveStarThemes` map from all 5-star read books. Themes are scored per-book with these thresholds:

| Count in 5★ reads | Bonus per matching theme |
|---|---|
| ≥ 40 | +5 |
| ≥ 25 | +4 |
| ≥ 12 | +3 |
| ≥ 4  | +2 |
| ≥ 1  | +1 |

Cap: +8 total per book regardless of theme count.

Current top themes (as of June 2026): `narrative nonfiction` (104), `thriller` (101), `contemporary` (38), `literary` (36), `memoir` (36), `psychological` (32), `speculative` (31), `suspense` (29), `history` (25), `sports` (25).

### How similarToTitles drives scoring

Two separate engine signals:

1. **Forward match** (candidate → 5★ read): If a to-read/candidate book's `similarToTitles` contains a title that is in the user's 5★ reads → **+8 pts per match**.

2. **Reverse index** (5★ read → candidate): If a 5★ read's `similarToTitles` contains a to-read book's title → **+6 pts per citing 5★ read, capped at +12**. This fires on the `reverseSimilar` map built in `buildIndexes`.

**Critical:** Both signals require exact title string matches. Always verify against the actual title stored in the JSON. Common pitfalls:
- Series notation: "The Firm" vs "The Firm (The Firm, #1)" — use the full title
- Subtitle truncation: "Bourdain: The Definitive Oral Biography" not "Bourdain"
- Subtitle differences: "Quiet: The Power of Introverts..." vs "Quiet Power: The Secret Strengths..."

## Adding a New Book

When adding a new book to `goodreadsData.json`, a complete entry looks like:

```json
{
  "title": "The Last Trial",
  "author": "Scott Turow",
  "shelf": "to-read",
  "myRating": 0,
  "pages": 384,
  "avgRating": 4.01,
  "ratingsCount": 12500,
  "year": 2020,
  "themes": ["legal", "thriller", "courtroom"],
  "similarToTitles": ["Presumed Innocent", "A Time to Kill", "The Client"]
}
```

- `similarToTitles` values must be exact matches to `title` fields in the dataset
- Check the canonical theme list above before inventing a new tag

## Evaluation Discipline (added Session 12 — do not skip)

Run `node scripts/eval.js` BEFORE and AFTER any engine change. It reports
precision@k over completed rated reads (leave-one-out, DNFs excluded — DNF
virtual ratings leak the answer and inflate metrics; header Spearman claims
predate this fix). Baseline as of Jul 3 2026: p10=100, p25=96, p50=96,
MAE=0.770. Top-of-list precision (p10/p25) outranks MAE: never trade it away.

**Measured dead ends — do not re-attempt without new data:**
- Author/theme weight tuning (upweighting low ratings, asymmetric variance
  penalty, halving PRIOR_K): flat or traded p25 for MAE. The model is at its
  ceiling; completed 2★ books look identical to 5★ books in all features.
- Negative-only description voting: strictly worse than symmetric.

**Real bottleneck:** negative training data. Only 39 dismissals and 106
low-rated completions whose features match loved books.

## TF-IDF Description Signal (descSimilarity.js, Session 12)

k-NN over TF-IDF vectors of real descriptions from data/enrichedMetadata.json
(filled daily by the enrich-metadata workflow, 150 books/run). Coverage-gated:
inactive until 150+ rated reads have descriptions. Tunables in exported CFG
(k=12, cap=6 — sweep-confirmed optimal). Flows: app.js → rankBBRE(…, meta) →
buildTasteModel(…, meta) → Signal 4b in predictRating.

## Workflows

- enrich-metadata.yml: daily 07:00 UTC; Google Books + Open Library →
  data/enrichedMetadata.json. Also usable for tag audits (publisher categories).
- tag-books.yml: manual; Claude Haiku 4.5 tags from descriptions; needs
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY repo secret (unused so far — Session 12 tagged by hand).
- Data conflicts: sync + enrichment commit daily. Rebase carefully; prefer
  re-layering enrichment fields (themes/tones/similarToTitles) onto upstream.

## Bill's Taste Rules (explicit, from Session 12 review)

- NO fiction set before 1900. Nonfiction pre-1900 settings are sometimes fine.
  Exception: Lonesome Dove (kept for its reputation). When tagging or
  dismissing, check historical fiction settings against this rule.

## Data Caveats

- Session 12 similarToTitles are validated-to-exist but unverified-as-good:
  picked from model knowledge, not measured. Treat as draft; description
  similarity can eventually audit them.
- All 136 DNFs carry myRating=2. engine.js treats them as ordinary 2★;
  rateEngine uses virtual ratings. Inconsistent — known, unresolved.
- similarToTitles entries MUST be exact 5★ read titles (norm() tolerates
  series suffixes, but stay exact).

## Data Enrichment Sessions Log

| Session | Work done |
|---------|-----------|
| 1–6 | Initial Goodreads import; candidatePool files built; ratingsCount on candidates |
| 7 | ratingsCount added to all 313 to-read books; engine wired ratingsCountBonus for to-read |
| 8 | Pages bonus added to to-read branch; themes tagged on all 260 five-star reads; themeBonus personalized |
| 9 | authorRatingWeight signal (replaces flat allReadAuthors count) |
| 10 | Themes tagged on all 241 un-themed read books; similarToTitles added to all 500 read books; reverseSimilar reverse index added to engine |

| 11 | similarToAuthors signal added to to-read branch (was already in pool branch); pages fixed on 2 to-read books |
| 12 (Jul 2026, claude.ai) | Persistence: dismissals now survive refresh via localStorage; "Copy feedback JSON" button commits them. Title matching normalized (norm()) in fiveStarTitles/reverseSimilar — series-notation mismatch bug class eliminated. similarToTitles enriched on all 292 to-read books (214 hand-tagged, 49 same-author auto-fill, all validated against exact 5★ titles). Dead themes remapped; 'domestic suspense' added to 19 clear cases. 9 missing bookKeys backfilled. 7 type errors fixed via publisher-category audit (incl. two 5★ reads: Best Offer Wins, The Stowaway). Series signal bugs fixed: decimal entries (#2.5) and collection first-entries now parse. NEW: descSimilarity.js TF-IDF signal (see below). NEW: scripts/eval.js. NEW: enrich_metadata.py + tag_with_haiku.py workflows. Repo hygiene: audit scripts → scripts/, 3.5MB PNG removed, text logo replaces image. |
